        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am George Coulouras, a student at UMass Amherst with a passion for writing, and this is my personal website!</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p> I am a junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a dual degree in English and Economics, as well as a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. I have also completed a minor in Psychology.</p>
        
        <h2>Writing Experience</h2>
        <p>I have had a lifelong passion for writing, dating back to my own sportswriting blog when I was little, and this passion evolved into choosing English as my course of study in college. In my coursework for the PWTC Certificate, I have produced quality written documentation, including a Microsoft Word user manual, and a grant proposal for the UMass Campus Pantry.</p>
        <p>I am also very involved with the Massachusetts Daily Collegian, the university's student-run newspaper, as a news writer and assistant news editor.</p>
        <p>This semester, I will be starting a new position within The Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence as a Research Computing Technical Writing Intern.</p>
